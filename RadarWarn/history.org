THE RADAR WARNING STORY




:En:
IN THE BEGINNING YEAR: 1965
In July 1965, an American F-4 Phantom II was shot down over North Vietnam. This loss represented the first American aircraft to be downed by an SA-2 Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) in the Southeast Asian conflict. This event heralded the beginning of a serious and lethal new challenge to American air superiority.
:END:
* 1965:伊始
1965年7月，一架美国F-4“幻影II”在北越被击落。这是第一架在东南亚冲突中被SA-2地对空导弹（SAM）击落的美国飞机。这一事件预示着一场针对美国空中优势的严重的致命新挑战拉开序幕。

:En:
In the succeeding months of the war, American aircraft would attempt to penetrate major targets in the North, and they would fly their missions into the teeth of the most sophisticated air defense network ever deployed in history.
The North Vietnam air defense system, as it evolved in the mid to late 1960s, consisted of AntiAircraft Artillery (AAA), SAMs and MIG fighter aircraft, all closely coordinated through the use of communications and radar. The need to counter this lethal new threat was painfully obvious as losses of aircraft and crew grew to unacceptable levels.
Brigadier General K.C. Dempster,
then Director of Operational Requirements and Development Plans, U.S. Air Force Headquarters, was selected to head a Blue Ribbon Air Staff Task Force to investigate methods of countering these lethal weapon systems in an effort to provide warning and protection to U.S. air crews against this new threat.
The need for aircraft self-protection assets was the driving force behind a seminar held in August 1965, and led to a recommendation for the development of aircraft avionics systems capable of detecting and destroying the controlling radars in these defense networks. The concept was appropriately named Wild Weasel, an animal known to hunt vermin.
Almost in disastrous parallel, a Navy
RA-5C reconnaissance aircraft was lost over Dienbienphu. Again, the culprit was the SA-2.
A $5.5 million aircraft was lost, causing considerable comment that the aircraft was too expensive to introduce into combat. Soviet-built SAM technology was threatening to destroy a much needed intelligence capability that had been developed and deployed at a cost of several hundred million dollars.
In parallel with the Dempster panel, DDR&E convened a committee to evaluate options and make selections for the development of a warning and jamming equipment suite. It was decided that of all the proposals received, a concept called Vector IV offered the best potential solution to the warning problem. As a result of this decision, a then-small company based in Northern California rocketed into national focus. The Vector IV concept was proposed by Applied Technology, Inc.
:END:
在战争的后续几个月中，美国飞机试图渗透北方的主要目标，他们的飞行任务要求飞机必须进入当时史上部署最复杂的防空网络。
北越防空系统是在20世纪60年代中后期发展起来的，由高射炮（AAA）、地空导弹和米格战斗机组成，通过通信和雷达进行密切协调。由于飞机和机组人员的损失增加到不可接受的水平，因此迫切需要应对这种致命的新威胁。
K.C.登普斯特准将，后任美国空军总部的作战需求和发展计划部主任，被选中组建一支蓝丝带空军参谋队伍，负责研究打击这些致命武器系统的方法，以便为美国空勤人员提供警示和保护，有效应对这一新威胁。
飞机自卫能力的需求促成了1965年8月举行的研讨会，会上提出了开发航空电子设备系统用于探测和摧毁防御网雷达的建议。这个概念被命名为野鼬任务（Wild Weasel）。
祸不单行，海军也在越南Dien bien phu损失了一架RA-5C侦察机。罪魁祸首依然是SA-2导弹。损失一架价值550万美元的飞机，这使得多数人都认为这样太昂贵的飞机是无法在战斗中使用的。苏联制造的SAM技术对数百万美元成本的、急需的、高度智能化的作战能力构成了毁灭性威胁。与Dempster小组并行，DDR＆E召集了一个委员会来评估告警和干扰设备组件的指标，并从中做出选择。在收到的所有方案中，一个名为Vector IV的概念最终成为告警问题的最佳潜在解决方案。这一决定也使得一家总部位于北加州的小型公司平步青云，一度成为国家焦点，这家公司就是应用技术公司（Applied Technology, Inc.）。

:En:
In November 1965, the USAF Sacramento Air Material Area awarded Applied Technology a contract for 500 AN/APR-25s, the system nomenclature for the Vector IV concept. The system was based on the use of crystal-video detection techniques in the threat bands only, where the hostile equipment’s relative direction was resolved by a CRT display using vectorial inputs from four antenna patterns. Thus, the initial concept name, Vector IV.
:END:
1965年11月，美国空军萨克拉门托空气材料区授予应用技术公司500批AN/APR-25的生产合同，AN/APR-25是Vector IV概念的系统命名法。该系统仅在威胁的频带中使用晶体视频检波技术，其中敌方信号的到达角通过四个指向不同的天线的矢量输入解决。这也是该系统最初被命名为Vector IV的原因。

:En:
Until this time, Applied Technology had been primarily involved in strategic reconnaissance and intelligence technology programs where a large production run consisted of 10 systems. The impact of the AN/APR-25 award was huge. Further, the U.S. Navy awarded Applied Technology a production order to outfit its aircraft with this critical new protective asset.
:END:
在这之前，应用技术公司主要参与战略侦察和情报技术计划，其主要产值由10个系统组成。AN/APR-25带来的利润是如此之大，修正了企业的发展方向。此外，美国海军还向应用技术公司核发了一份生产订单，为其飞机配备这一重要的新式自卫手段。


:En:
Very little was known about the threat in those early days, and the design philosophies of warning systems were based upon gathering as much signal information as available. Later this philosophy would change as the need for sorting analysis and prioritization of lethal pulses became semi-automatic.
:END:
最初，人们对威胁的信息知之甚少，告警系统的设计理念基于尽可能多的收集信号信息。后来，由于需要实现对分类和致命脉冲优先级的半自动化分析，这种理念就慢慢发生了变化。


:En:
On a Friday the 13th in 1966, Applied Technology’s AN/APR-26 radar warning receiver performed successfully in a combat mission and added yet another success for the growing company. In the 1966 – 1967 time frame, Applied Technology was shipping radar homing and warning systems at a rate of 250 per month. Employment levels approached 1,400, a seven-fold increase in just two years.
:END:
1966年的一个星期五，应用技术公司的AN/APR-26雷达告警接收器在一次战斗任务中成功完成了它的首秀，并为这家不断发展的公司带来了又一次成功。在1966至1967年，应用技术公司以每月250个的速度交付雷达制导和预警系统。就业水平接近1,400，仅仅两年就增长了7倍。


:En:
The AN/APR-36 and AN/APR-37 were updates to U.S. Air Force AN/APR-25/26 systems. Continually pressing the edge of technology for new ways to protect aircraft and crews, Applied Technology developed and added features such as automatic time/video correlation circuits. At the same time, the company developed a superheterodyne analysis receiver in the form of the AN/APR-35 system.
:END:
AN/APR-36和AN/APR-37是对美国空军AN/APR-25/26系统的更新。应用技术公司不断突破技术优势，为保护飞机和机组人员提供新的方法，开发并加装了时间/视频自相关电路等功能。与此同时，该公司开发了AN/APR-35系统为代表的超外差接收机。

:En:
This second generation system was quickly fitted into all Wild Weasel aircraft. The new equipment provided the Electronic Warfare Operators (EWO) with imporoved capability to discretely assess the threat.
:END:
第二代系统很快就安装在所有野鼬行动的飞机上。新设备为电子战操作员（EWO）提供了独立评估威胁的能力。


:En:
It was during their support of strike missions into North Vietnam that the Wild Weasels won their motto of “first in and last out.” The Weasels flew well in advance of strike aircraft and actually baited hostile SAMs to clear a safe corridor for the follower aircraft to enter and reach the target. The Weasels rolled back the SAM sites through bait or attack of the sites. As they detected SAMs along the strike route, they also provided warning to strike aircraft when they detected a SAM launch. This provided an instant alert and maximum reaction time for evasive action. U.S. Air Force B-52s were never sent into North Vietnam, or any other areas within possible range of SAMs, without a Wild Weasel escort.
:END:
正是在支持北越的入境打击任务期间，野鼬队赢得了“最先到达，最后撤离”的美誉。野鼬飞机的起飞先于执行打击任务的飞机[fn:1]，实际上野鼬飞机主要任务是诱使敌面空导弹发射，从而为后续飞机清理出顺利进入目标区域的安全走廊。野鼬飞机通过电子欺骗或电子攻击压制SAM防护网。当他们探测到地空导弹时，还可提供导弹发射告警，这为规避导弹提供了即时的警报和较长的反应时间。在没有野鼬护航时，美国空军的B-52从未被派往北越或者存在面空导弹威胁的任何其他区域。


:En:
New technology had been deployed at the scene of the battle, and the use of Applied Technology’s radar homing and warning equipment played a key role in the success of the engagements.
:END:
应用技术公司在战场部署雷达寻的和警告设备这样的新技术，为作战任务的成功发挥了关键作用。

:En:
The action taken to interface this new technology with needs of a pilot and an EWO required unprecedented military and industry teamwork. Tense pilots, busy flying their aircraft with full knowledge of their illumination by a SAM, did not have the time to work with a potentiometer or a confusing jumble of strobes. The action to address this issue was is one of the most critical successes of the Wild Weasel program. Teamwork between the pilot and EWO developed to a point where communications were instantaneous, with the EWO making quick interpretations from displays and providing instructions to the pilot as to “which way to duck.” When a SAM was fired at a Weasel aircraft, there was no time for discussion as survival demanded speed. The improvements made in operator interface began to pay off in lifesaving dividends.
:END:
将这项新技术与飞行员和电子战操作员的需求联系起来并采取行动，需要军队和工业部门开展前所未有的团队合作。在被面空导弹照射时，紧张的飞行员忙与操纵飞机，无瑕应对电位器或杂乱的闪光灯。解决这个问题所做的努力是野鼬计划最重要的成功之一。飞行员和电子战操作员之间的合作发展到了即时通信的地步，电子战操作员通过显示器快速解释并向飞行员提供关于“哪种方式躲避”的指示。当导弹射向野鼬飞机这样千钧一发的时刻，根本没有讨论的时间。操作员界面的改进开始在实际中得到回报―降低战损率。


:En:
At the same time, new information continued to surface about the subtleties of the various threats. After analysis, new logic and techniques were consistently incorporated in true Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) fashion in operational systems on board strike aircraft. When a new requirement originated in Da Nang, in some cases, only 72 hours passed before an Applied Technology representative was performing installation changes.
:END:
与此同时，关于各种威胁的微妙信息陆续浮出水面。经分析，新的逻辑和技术始终以真正的快速反应能力（QRC）方式加入攻击机的操作系统。为了应对岘港出现的新需求，在某些情况下，在应用技术公司的代表执行安装更改之前仅用了72小时。


TIMES CHANGE
* 时代变了

:En:
In 1969, the hostile chess game assumed new proportions with the fielding of more lethal SAMs and AAAs. The U.S. Navy, upon perception of the Mediterranean Threat impact, initiated action that resulted in the next generation warning systems for Naval attack aircraft, the AN/ALR-45. It was the first digital system which incorporated hybrid microcircuits using digital logic and clock drivers. From 1970 – 1974, the AN/ALR-45 was introduced to the Fleet.
:END:
1969年，军备竞赛致使越来越多的地空导弹和高射炮出现在防空网中。美国海军在受地中海威胁影响后，开始采取行动，为海军攻击机制造下一代预警系统―AN/ALR-45。这是第一个采用数字逻辑和时钟驱动器的混合微电路数字系统。在1970-1974年这段时间，AN/ALR-45被引入海军舰队。

As the threat scenario continued to proliferate into a lethal array of densely deployed weapons of varying types, frequencies and modulation methods, a new realization emerged. Previous design philosophies were based on obtaining as much signal data as possible. Now, it became necessary to start discarding non-lethal threat information. Prioritization of threats and emitter tagging became critical. Only computational power could solve this increasingly complex technical problem. Unambiguous warning, coupled with ease of use, heralded the end of analog control in the aircraft warning function.
:END:
随着各种类型、工作频率和调制方式的致命武器系列陆续出现，威胁场景越来越常见，一种新的认识逐渐形成。以前的设计理念基于获得尽可能多的信号数据。现在，有必要丢弃非致命的威胁信息。威胁和辐射源标记的优先级变得至关重要。只有提升计算能力才能解决这个日益复杂的技术难题。明确无糢糊的告警、外加易于使用的特点，预示着飞机告警模拟控制时代的终结。

** ALR-46

   [[file:history.org_imgs/20181119_205049_1776KcM.png]]
:En:
The U.S. Air Force, as part of its ALR-46 program, was the first to field a digital, software-controlled radar warning receiver.
In late 1971, a fundamental change took place at Applied Technology. In its continual quest to lead technology innovations, the company was changed from an analog circuit design house to a computer sciences house. Cost was a major motive in this change.
In mid-1972, Applied Technology was in the midst of purchasing a militarized computer with an architecture similar to that of a standard avionics computer. Management review of the situation noted an indelible trend of the future need for more costly computer systems. The determination that a circuit board improvement to the ALR-45 could be duplicated by low cost memory, if the CPU was fast enough, provided a more attractive option. The solution resulted in an effective application of another new technology, the Vector V warning concept, and a next generation Applied Technology system.
Based on a processing concept that was built around a variable programmer-alarmer idea, software routines were created so that probability statements on frequency/PRI, PRF, Pulse Width, Pulse Coding, etc., could be constantly analyzed.
The initial study resulted in the idea that conditional probability statements with determinant pairs of frequency and PRI represented an effective, processing technique. Creating a computer capable of handling large volumes of data was the over-riding philosophy, but dramatic technological change had begun.
:END:
作为美国空军ALR-46计划的一部分，第一个使用数字软件控制的雷达告警接收器诞生了。
1971年末，应用技术公司发生了根本性的变革。在不断追求技术创新的过程中，公司从模拟电路设计公司转变为计算机科学公司。成本是这一变革的主要动机。
1972年中期，应用技术公司正在购买一台军用计算机，其架构类似于标准航空电子计算机。管理层通过局势的评估，注意到未来需要更昂贵的计算机系统，这是大势所趋。有一点可以确定，在ALR-45电路板上下功夫所带来的改进可以通过低成本存储器实现，这提供了更具吸引力的选择。该解决方案成功应用了另一项新技术―Vector V告警概念，这也是下一代应用技术系统。
基于围绕可变编程告警器思想构建的处理概念，创建了软件程序，以便持续地分析频率/PRI、PRF、脉冲宽度、脉冲编码等信息。
初步的研究结论是，频率和PRI具有明确定特征的参数对代表了一种有效的处理。虽然当时最为重要的是提出创建一台能够处理大量数据的计算机这一理念，但是巨大的技术变革已经在路上了。

:En:
In late 1972, Applied Technology established a goal to develop the world’s first computer specifically designed for electronic warfare applications. The system would occupy 100 cubic inches in volume, consume 80 watts in power and realize a 250K words per second I/O rate. Also, the computer would deinterleave pulse trains and be capable of squadron-level reprogramming using flight line equipment.
Results were impressive. In July 1973, the Applied Technology Advanced Computer (ATAC) was implemented. Cost was well within targeted goals, volume was only 96 cubic inches, power consumption was 45 watts instead of 80 watts and the I/O rate was 1.25 megawords per second, representing a five-fold improvement over the initial design goals.
The new ATAC computer was subsequently injected into the Vector V program and resulted in a third generation system which incorporated all advancements in microprocessor and microcode technology.
The Vector V signal data converter formed the basis of the AN/ALR-68(V), as well as the nucleus of the Enhanced Radar Warning Equipment used on the MRCA Tornado.
The concept of computer managed power allocation of jamming assets began gathering favor. An aircraft flying into the forward edge of a battle area, facing SAM and AAA weapons, which are all controlled by a variety of radars, needed to intelligently use its radiative power. The jammers were used to spoof, or otherwise blot out the return to the hostile radar receiver. Integrated power management systems, using state-of-the-art computer processing, collected and analyzed multiple threats and provided real-time data for optimum jamming capabilities.
:END:
1972年末，应用技术公司制定了一个明确的目标：开发世界上第一台专为电子战应用而设计的计算机。该系统体积100立方英寸，功耗80瓦，实现每秒250K字的I/O速率。此外，计算机将对脉冲序列进行去交错，并能够使用飞行线路设备实现中队级再编程。
结果是令人印象深刻的。1973年7月，应用技术高级计算机（ATAC）得以实施。成本完全符合目标，体积仅为96立方英寸，功耗为45瓦而不是80瓦，I/O速率为每秒1.25兆字，比初始设计目标提高了五倍。
随后，新的ATAC计算机加入到Vector V计划中，并产生了第三代系统，该系统结合了微处理器和微程序方面的所有技术进步。
Vector V信号数据转换器构成了AN/ALR-68(V)的基础，以及MRCA Tornado上使用的增强型雷达告警设备的核心。
计算机管理的干扰资源配置概念开始受到青睐。一架飞机进入战区前线，面对由各种雷达控制的面空导弹和高射炮武器威胁，需要智能地使用其辐射功率。干扰机使用欺骗或以其他方式将信息调制到对方的雷达回波中。集成了功率管理系统，使用最先进的计算机处理技术，收集和分析多种威胁，并提供实时数据以实现最佳干扰能力。
[[file:history.org_imgs/20181119_205128_1776XmS.png]]
:En:
The typical power management suite implied a “look through” time for the radar warning receiver. The implicit need for speed and prioritized threat warning information passed to jammers pushed technology to yet another frontier.
Recognizing the need for coordinated use of electronic warfare assets, the U.S. Navy initiated the development of its third generation warning receiver for the EA-6B Prowler electronic warfare aircraft, called the CWCS program. In 1974, intense competition surrounded this coveted program solicitation, as an entire fleet retrofit and new aircraft inventory programs were on the horizon.
In 1975, Applied Technology was awarded the CWCS program, now called the AN/ALR-67 countermeasures warning and control system.
At the same time, the U.S. Air Force also had other major programs underway, the ALR-46 and the AN/ALR-69.
:END:
典型的功率管理套件暗含了雷达告警器的“透视”时间。传递给干扰器的速度和优先威胁警告信息的隐含需求将技术推向了另一个边界。
认识到需要协调使用电子战资源，美国海军开始为EA-6B徘徊者电子战飞机开发第三代警告接收器，称为CWCS计划。 1974年，围绕着这个令人垂涎的计划征集是异常激烈的竞争，因为与之相应的整机队改造以及新飞机库存计划即将出台。
1975年，应用技术公司成功竞标CWCS计划，现称为AN/ALR-67电子战告警和控制系统。
与此同时，美国空军也正在进行其他重大计划，即ALR-46和AN/ALR-69。

Litton Applied Technology’s reputation for providing products with exceptional performance records in combat was reinforced again during Desert Storm. Litton threat warning systems were flown onboard 80% of the 1,000 U.S. fixed wing aircraft, and 100% of Canadian and Kuwait combat aircraft. Litton Applied Technology systems flown included the: ALR-69 on F-16, A-10 and MC/AC-130 aircraft; ALR-46 on B-52, RF-4C and MC/AC-130 aircraft and ALR-67 on F/A-18, A-6, F-14A and AV-8B aircraft. Coalition forces equipped with Litton threat warning systems achieved nearly perfect survivability rates. Installed EW systems and operational tactics were flown in more than 2000 combat sorties the first 48 hours of the war. Although many SAMs were fired, only one aircraft was lost to missile fire. This one loss amounts to an almost unbelievable low attrition rate of 0.05%. Standard attrition percentages used by Military Air Planners are 0.3% for the first 24 hours of combat operations.
During the 42 days of Desert Storm operations, USN/USMC pilots flew 28,000 sorties with a total of 7 aircraft combat losses for an attrition rate of 0.025%. Combat pilots repeatedly praised the unambiguous threat identification and timely warning of Litton radar warning systems even in the presence of jammers, numerous hostile threat systems and large numbers of friendly radars.
Since the beginning of the electronic warfare environment, Litton’s Applied Technology division has designed and produced threat warning systems to meet the most severe tests. Not since the first threat warning system, the APR-25, was exposed to combat in the skies over Viet Nam, has the company’s products been so critically tested. Pilots who flew in Viet Nam found the Iraqi air defenses as tough or more difficult than anything they had ever flown against. A member of the U.S. House of Representatives’ Intelligence Committee was quoted as saying, “next to Moscow, Baghdad is the most heavily defended target we might ever have planned to go against.” Threats faced and survived by coalition air forces included the SA-2, SA-3,
SA-7, SA-8, SA-9 SA-14, Improved Hawk, Roland, Crotale, ZSU-23, multiple AAAs and various Soviet and French-made Iraqi aircraft.
Air Force and Navy pilots reported that flack from AAA and SAM missiles was so heavy over target areas that without effective threat warning and coordinated countermeasures, many more aircraft would have been lost.

在沙漠风暴行动的42天期间，USN/USMC飞行员共飞行28000架次，共有7架飞机失事，损失率为0.025％。战斗飞行员反复赞扬即使在有干扰器、众多敌方威胁系统和大量非威胁雷达的环境下，利顿雷达告警系统依然能进行明确的威胁识别和及时警告。
自从电子战环境开始受重视以来，利顿的应用技术部门设计并制作了威胁告警系统，以满足最严苛的测试需求。不过，并不是从第一个威胁告警系统开始（在越南领空受战争洗礼的APR-25），公司的产品就一直受如此严峻的考验。即使在越南飞过的飞行员也表示伊拉克的防空系统是他们遇到过的最强的。引述美国众议院情报委员会的一名成员说法：“除了莫斯科，巴格达是我们可能将要应对的最为严俊的防御目标。”联盟空军应对了这些威胁并幸存下来：SA-2、SA-3、SA-7、SA-8、SA-9、SA-14，以及改进的Hawk、Roland、Crotale、ZSU-23，多个高射炮和苏联和法国制造的各种伊拉克飞机。 空军和海军的飞行员在报告中称，在目标区域部署了如此多的高射炮和面空导弹，如果没有有效的威胁告警和电子对抗，将损失更多的飞机。

*** ALR-91(V) 系列威胁告警系统
[[file:history.org_imgs/20181119_205446_1776k3M.png]]
:En:
The principle technology breakthrough provided by the ALR-91(V) Series threat warning systems is the capability to continuously collect and analyze radar signals over the full 0.5 to 18.0 GHz frequency range. Prior and current generation systems are constrained in that collection and analysis capabilities of radar signal data are limited to a portion of the frequency range. Typically, other systems are of “band sampling” type; that is they collect and analyze signal data of one band at a time. Three or four bands are usually required to cover the full frequency range. Detection of radar signals on other bands is not possible when a band sampling is underway. The ALR-91(V) Series does not require band sampling, as all bands are collected at the same time. This new capability allows detection of all tactical radars as soon as aircraft tracking begins.
The capability to continuously collect and analyze radar signals over the full frequency range is made possible because of recent breakthroughs in the design of Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC). A set of these VLSI ASIC chips was developed by Litton to enable the ALR-91(V) Series to rapidly detect and provide warning of the growing number of phased array radars. Software programmable, these chips automatically:
:END:
ALR-91(V)系列威胁预警系统的主要技术突破是能够在整个0.5至18.0GHz频率范围内连续收集和分析雷达信号。在ALR-91(V)出现前，雷达信号数据的收集和分析能力仅限于部分频率范围。其他系统通常是“带限采样”类型，也就是说，他们一次只收集和分析一个频段的信号数据。通常需要三至四个频段来覆盖整个频率范围。在执行频带采样时，无法检测其他频段上的雷达信号。 ALR-91(V)系列不需要频带采样，因为所有频段都是瞬时采集的。这种新功能可以在跟踪开始时就立即检测到所有战术雷达。
得益于在超大规模集成电路(VLSI)专用集成电路(ASIC)设计方面取得的突破，ALR-91(V)可以在整个频率范围内连续收集和分析雷达信号。 利顿开发了一套VLSI ASIC芯片，使ALR-91(V)系列能够快速检测并提供日益增多的相控阵雷达的告警。软件是可编程的，这些芯片自动完成：

:En:
•	Collect radar signal pulse data;

•	Sort each pulse by frequency, angle and amplitude;

•	Store the sorted pulses in separate memory areas;

•	Store only the desired number of pulses from each radar signal, and Remove redundant pulses.
:END:
- 收集雷达信号脉冲数据;

- 按频率、角度和幅度对每个脉冲进行排序;

- 将分类的脉冲存储在单独的存储区中;

- 仅存储区分来自每个雷达的信号所需的脉冲数，并去除冗余脉冲。

The ALR-91(V) Series threat warning systems detect, analyze and identify all known types of tactical threat radars in less than two seconds. The systems have been successfully tested against the full range of standard and modern radar types.
:END:
ALR-91(V)系列威胁警告系统可在不到两秒的时间内检测、分析和识别所有已知类型的威胁战术雷达。该系统已成功通过各种标准的和现代雷达的测试。


*** ALR-93(V) 系列的威胁告警和ESM系统

The principle technology breakthrough provided by the ALR-93(V) Series Threat Warning and ESM systems is continuous collection and analysis of radar signals in complex environments. The ALR-93(V) is an effective asset to use against these modern threats including:

ALR-93(V)威胁警告和ESM系统是一种覆盖C-J频段的轻量级、高灵敏度系统，用于在密集、复杂的信号环境中运行，具有很高的信号截获能力。其独特的架构，结合先进的技术和先进的封装理念，形成了一个重量不到55磅的高性能、小尺寸系统，并满足当今战斗机所需的关键要求。
ALR-93(V)系列威胁警告和ESM系统提供的主要技术突破是在复杂环境中连续收集和分析雷达信号。 ALR-93(V)是用于防御下述威胁的有效装备，包括：

:En:
•	Lethal radars that operate in CW, wide pulse widths and/or high duty cycle (Pulse Doppler);

•	Lethal scanning radars (track-while-scan);

•	High duty cycle emitters capable of masking the detection of other radars; and

•	Simultaneous agility in PRI and RF parameters.
:END:

- 致命扫描雷达（边扫边跟）;

- 高重频辐射源，能够遮蔽其他雷达的探测探测信号；

- PRI和RF参数的同时捷变。


:En:
The ALR-93(V)’s unique receiver configuration contributes to its effective operation. Baseband receivers and a wide acquisition bandwidth Instantaneous Frequency Measurement (IFM) receiver cover the entire frequency spectrum in continuous bands while maintaining a high probability of intercept. This capability minimizes the time required to cover the entire RF spectrum and provides pulse-to-pulse frequency measurement of even the most frequency agile radars. The IFM provides the key discriminator to the emitter analysis process, and significantly contributes to its ability to operate in high density environments.
The ALR-93 incorporates a superhet receiver for high sensitivity and high selectivity with narrowband frequency search modes. The SHR scanning capability further contributes to the elimination of ambiguities by resolving and/or looking around multiple high duty cycle Pulse Doppler and CW emissions radiating at closely spaced frequencies and bearings.
The ALR-93(V) Series contains hardware and software tools which function auto-matically and without degradation in high density environments, and addresses the problem of high duty cycle signal corruption and the acquisition of pulsed emissions in the presence of these signals. This includes environment filtering at RF and video, narrowband SHR search and preprocessing.

ALR-93(V)独有的接收机配置有助于它的有效运行。基带接收机和宽带瞬时测频(IFM)接收机覆盖整个连续的频谱，同时保持很高的截获概率。这种功能可以最大限度地缩短整个RF频谱的搜索时间，并提供脉冲到脉冲的频率测量，即使是最复杂的频率捷变雷达也不在话下。IFM为辐射源分析提供了关键鉴别能力，并显著提高了在高信号密度环境中的运行能力。
ALR-93采用超外差接收机，具有窄带频率搜索模式的高灵敏度和高的频率选择性。SHR扫描方式进一步增强了对辐射源的解糢糊能力，通过分辨多个频率非常接近的高重频脉冲多普勒和连续波信号实现。
ALR-93(V)系列包含硬件和软件工具，包括RF和视频的滤波、窄带SHR搜索和预处理，这些工具可自动运行且在高密度环境中不降低性能，并解决高重频信号污染时获取脉冲辐射源。
